			<h2>Greatest Growth Statement</h2>
					
			<p>This year overall as a seventh grader I think I have grown in not overworking myself when I do not need to. I used to stress myself out over not a lot of homework but now I know not to stress about it because if I focus I will be able to get it done. The benefit of growing in this is that I can appreciate life instead of getting stressed about everything. Now I also have time to spend with my sister, family, and friends.</p> 
					
			</br>
			</br>
			
			<h2>MY JOURNEY IN INQUIRY</h2>
			<h3>(Wellness/Fitness)</h3>
			
			</br>
			
			<p>What strategies have you used to efficiently find dependable and needed information when researching? I, at first, was not the best researcher. I had a hard time finding valuable information from a reliable website. When I researched for the Communicable Diseases Bulletin Board Project I grew in inquiry because I needed to find reliable information on specific diseases. Inquiry means to strive to gain factual knowledge. Most of the information I needed was provided in a packet, but the rest of the data I needed to look up online and find, which was challenging because I needed to find the information on a website with factual information and check to make sure the information is correct on other websites. This year, I have grown in the quality of inquiry, which has helped me become better at gathering valuable and reliable information through research.</p>
			
			</br>
				
			<p>The project that most obviously shows how much I have truly grown in inquiry and improved my efficiency in gathering beneficial and sound data when researching is the Communicable Diseases Bulletin Board Project. The project was done in partners and took place in Wellness/Fitness and Math. The goal of the Communicable Diseases Project was to create an informational poster board about a certain theme that applies to four communicable diseases, the poster board should also include a tessellation of shapes that relate to the theme. A tessellation is a shape that can repeatedly fit together and can be repeated without any space in between the shapes. The Communicable Diseases Bulletin Boards will now be displayed in different health care facilities to inform people on the diseases and how to prevent the spread of them.</p>
			
			</br>
				
			<p>The diseases that we could choose from were all common in the Dayton, Ohio area so it would apply to all the people that read them. A communicable disease is a disease that can be transmitted from one organism to another. First, we learned about the epidemiological triangle which shows my starting point for developing inquiry skills and also is my first artifact. The epidemiological triangle is important because it was the first step I took to gather the information I would need. The epidemiological triangle contains the agent (the type of pathogen, what the common name is, and what the medical term is), the host (the location inside of your body that it will survive, the gender or age group the disease prefers, and the symptoms), and the environment (where the disease lives outside of the host, the incubation period, how long you are contagious, how long you have the disease, and the setting the disease is most common). This helped me learn to do higher quality research because it required me to find information I did not have. After learning this, we filled out an epidemiological triangle for each of the four diseases we chose, which were Tuberculosis, Group A Streptococcal, the Meningococcal diseases, and Measles. All four of these diseases can be transmitted through the air, which was our theme. To fill out the epidemiological triangle we used printed packets from the CDC that were approved by Mrs. Curran, our Wellness/Fitness teacher. We then narrowed the information down to only the data needed, typed it up, and glued it to the final poster board. The ending information on the disease descriptions shows how much my inquiry skills have improved, therefore it is also an artifact that shows my growth. The descriptions of the diseases on the poster board show growth because it shows how I used all the information I collected. Because we narrowed the data down to only the information needed, people will not get uninterested when reading the poster board. All of these steps helped me create a poster board that has factual information and has helped make my researching skills and strategies better.</p>
			
			</br>
				
			<p>Because I have improved in the quality of inquiry, I have grown in my ability to extract useful data from meaningless data, and in my ability to find the information I am missing. At the beginning of this project and before that I had trouble finding the information I needed and to improve on this I scanned websites quickly looking for the information needed. When I found this data, I checked other websites to see if they had the same answers and the information was factual. To find what I needed I also had to type in to the search box keywords that correspond to the topic to get the data and websites that include the necessary information. Inquiry is an important quality to be proficient in because later, when I am in college and high school it will be demanded of me to quickly complete assignments that need accurate information from the Internet.</p>

			<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION</h2> 
			<h3>STEM Foundations</h3>
			
			</br>
				
			<p>Tony Robbins once said, “To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.” Before the Storybook project I had a hard time communicating my ideas and the other person being able to correctly interpret what I was saying and trying to do. This quote represents what I did to help improve my communication, because I realized that my partner, Bri, was an artist so I considered this when I tried to communicate to her my ideas. While we were working on the images for our Storybook I started to communicate to Bri what I wanted the final image to look like and what techniques we could use to reach that style of image. To communicate means to productively get your ideas across in a group of people so that everyone understands it. Because I have grown in the quality of communication, I have become skilled at being productive and can now participate more in group projects because people understand what I am saying.</p>
			
			</br>
				
			<p>The project that best shows my growth in communication is the images created during the Storybook Project. My growth in communication has helped me become a better group member and converse so my ideas can be understood by everyone. During the Storybook project I worked with my partner Bri, the project was worked on in Language Arts, STEM Foundations, and Wellness/Fitness, but the images were specifically worked on in STEM Foundations. Some of the requirements included at least one image per spread, which is two pages, and the use of only three hues throughout all the images. The goal of the project was to create a book that can be understood by 3rd to 5th graders and would teach them conflict resolution skills. Conflict resolution means to solve a problem that you are having with other people.</p>
				
			</br>	
				
			<p>First, we learned about the different tools in Adobe Illustrator, which is a software program that is used to create vector images. Next, we practiced creating images using the tools. After that, we created a small book of prototypes for each spread and image so that assembling the book would not be as hard. The prototype shows how my images started before I realized how to effectively communicate with Bri and marks the beginning of my growth in communication. The prototype displays our level of communication when were still getting used to working with each other and how because this was limited it affected the quality of our work. We made many revisions and received many sets of critiques on our Storybook so it would become as successful as possible. Finally, we made many drafts of images, got each image approved, and put all the images in to a PowerPoint. The final PowerPoint with images shows how the images were improved after effectively communicating and shows how I grew in communication while working together to complete images on time, still make them look organized, and understand which ones we still had to do. The Storybook has been donated to Heywood Elementary in Mrs. Abke’s 1st-3rd grade class. Because I am now proficient in communication I will be able to contribute more to group work and will later in life use this to do tasks efficiently with other people.</p>
				
			</br>	
				
			This year I have grown in the quality of communication during the STEM Foundations part of the Storybook project, which has helped me become better at working in groups and communicating in a way that helps people understand my ideas. Even though at first I had a hard time getting my ideas across and communicating, I began to realize that for others to understand what I am trying to say I have to explain it in a way specific to that person so they can understand it. My growth can be seen when I created images in STEM Foundations with my partner Bri. The prototype is slightly unorganized and not very neat, but the final images are detailed, purposeful, and organized. This is an important quality to grow in because you are often required to work in groups or talk with other people. To do well in life you need people to be able to understand you, work productively with you, and comprehend what your ideas are, otherwise it will be hard to get work done.</p>
