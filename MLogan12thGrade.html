			<h2>Greatest Growth Statement</h2>
			
			<p>My greatest growth while at DRSS was coming out of my shell and becoming more courageous, as well as gaining self-confidence. This growth has led me to new experiences and find new passions. Being more extroverted and willing to go outside of my comfort zone will allow me to be more successful in college and have better job opportunities. In college, everything and everyone is new, and not letting this overwhelm me will help me enjoy it more, meet more people, and join more extracurriculars. At college you have to be able to advocate for yourself, and at DRSS I have learned and practiced how to push myself to talk to teachers and be honest with them. In the job interviewing process, most companies are looking for team players and communication skills. Extroversion gives you an edge as these things will seem more natural.</p>

			<p>The biggest leap I have taken at DRSS is most likely the courage that it took to come here in 6th grade. I had just gotten out of a middle school where I was bullied for a couple of years, and my parents, after finding out the quality of education from my home highschool, decided to start researching other options. We applied to DRSS and recieved my acceptence later in the summer. I was able to do the tour where you follow around a student in the grade above you for a day. This allowed me to see that this school was a great fit for me, but that did not stop the anxiety from having to attend a school where I knew no one. I was one of the only students to come from north of I-75 and this increased my worries. My parents assured me that I had no other option, so I reluctantly came on the first day. Despite my intial shyness, I was able to make friends, and that is what helped me to come back every day after.</p>

			<p>CISV (Children's International Summer Village) is an international youth peace focused organization made up of chapters from around the world. It is run and maintained mostly by the youth in the chapters and the non-profit hosts camps for specific ages where delegations of four or more children come from up to 12 countries. The camps can be anywhere from 2 weeks to a month. At the age of 11 I experienced my first traveling experience with CISV. The program was called "Village" and I traveled with one other girl, two boys, and an adult from the US to Finland. There I spent a month with 48 11-year-olds from twelve different countries and did educational activities, learned about different cultures, and made friends with people from around the world. Before leaving my parents, home, and country for a month, I had a few panic attacks, overwhelmed by the idea of a setting so unfamiliar. But, I was able to overcome this and had one of the most impactful experiences of my life. I then went on to do other camps at ages 12, 13, and 15. Each time I would get anxious before leaving, but would be able to overlook this, knowing that I had already mastered my feelings once and picturing how much fun I would have.</p>

			</div>  <!-- End of Center -->
			
			<p>Sophmore year, I created a Science Fair project with my partner Aruna. We were halfway done when she was unexpectedly transfering to another school all the way in Arizona. This made me extremely nervous when Science Fair presentations came around and I had to present everything by myself. But, I studied the material, read up on other related topics that the evaluators could ask me about and ended up receiving the most awards that year.</p>

			<h3>Artifact 4</h3>
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/12thGradePage/MLogan_HockeyArtifact.JPG" alt="Picture Depicting Hockey" width="60%">
			</div>  <!-- End of Center -->
			
			<p>At the end of my sophomore year, I decided to try hockey with the goal of joinging my high school team. When I first decided to do this, I had no idea how hard it would be. First I had to make the transition from figure skating to hockey. I came to open skates and practiced my shooting and stick handeling, preparing for Troy High School Hockey’s Summer Camp. And when the camp came around, I was ill preprared, not having played a contact sport before, barely able to stick handle, barely an idea how to play hockey, and having to learn all of this infront of twenty teenage boys. It was probably my worst nightmare. It didn’t get any easier, and I was constantly embarrassed and uncomfortable. But I showed up to every practice at 5:30am, I worked on my shooting, I watched carefully when plays were being explained, and I ended the season with the best plus/minus on the team (amount of goals scored by your team minus the amount of goals scored against you while you are on the ice). I discovered a new passion because of overcoming my own preconcieved limitations.</p>

			</div>  <!-- End of Center -->
			
			<p>At the beginning of my senior year, I wanted to explore my interests in order to better choose a major in college. I decided that the best was to do this was through an elective called CAMP Dosser. This class allowed us experential learning in additive manufactoring, something I had no experience in. I figured that many other inexperienced people would be applying to join the class due to the work experience and appeal on a Resume. I was extremely suprise when I came to training that there were only four other students, all of whom owned a 3D printer or had extensive additive manufactoring knowledge. Despite this, I still stuck with CAMP Dosser and have learned so much about using different manufactoring techniques because of it.</p>
