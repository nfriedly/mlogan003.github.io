			<p>The purpose of this career exploration report was to identify two possible futures careers, research them, and find four feasible internships in the area. The careers chosen to investigate and find internships for were an intelligence analyst and neurologist. To learn more about each occupation, essential questions were written; these questions helped to guide the research and ensure that the report included all the relevant and important information. Then, the critical subjects of salary, daily responsibilities, necessary qualities, work environment, education, and possible college majors were explored for each profession. The most prevalently used websites were O*NET, Northeastern University, International Relations EDU, Highland Hospital, and Prospects. A combination of government, informational, and university sites were used. Finally, internships were investigated, focusing on the Dayton area and the sought-after work environment. The most promising internship is the Air Force Cognitive Neuroscience Research Lab because it combines research, developing medical interventions, and break-through neurology. Next steps include looking for colleges that are top in the relevant majors for the career and contacting the potential internships.</p>
