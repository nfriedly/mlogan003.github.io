			<h2>My 9th Grade Year</h2>
			
			<p>When 9th grade first began, I was naïve, stressed over inconsequential details, and lacking self-confidence. Since only August I have changed in many ways, I have more trust in myself, the choices I make, and understand my morals much better. Right before this school year began, many things changed for me, where I lived, my family’s dynamic, and many of my friendships. No one likes change, but I thought I had come to be prepared for it (I was not). All of this left me feeling unstable at the beginning of the school year. So I adapted, I changed how I viewed my schoolwork, my life, and my relationships. I became less obsessed with my schoolwork and began looking at the overall picture; I decided what I wanted from high school and how much work I was willing to put in to achieve it. I set expectations for myself and did not let school consume the rest of my life. I focused on the present and let the future come, knowing I could readjust to whatever challenges I faced. As a student, I am prepared for 10th grade and the rigors that come with it because I will acclimatize based on what is needed from me and the problems I face, and I will set reasonable expectations for myself.</p>

			<h3>How I Excelled...</h3>
			
			<p>To excel means to be superior, to surpass in accomplishment or achievement. There are many projects where I succeeded in meeting the end goals, but this does not necessarily mean that I went above and beyond. The project that I excelled the most in was the Unreal project in History. The Unreal Engine is a game engine developed by Epic Games, features a high degree of portability, and is a tool used by many game developers today. The goal of the project was to represent different periods throughout history by means of an interactive video game. We used Unreal Engine 4 to create a museum that is interactive and experience Women’s History, African American History, and Industrialization. To do this we started my learning how to use Unreal and its materials. We did this through online tutorials and experimenting. I had never created a video game or used Unreal before, so thankfully, we started with the basics and were allowed to go at our own pace. When starting the museum itself, we started with basic building materials and textures. Basic materials are shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders, rectangular prisms, etc.) that can be moved, rotated, and manipulated. These make up almost my entire museum and are differentiated by textures. The textures are a print, pattern, or color applied on a shape. As we got more comfortable with the tools and methods, we started customizing our museum.</p>

				<p class="caption">These are images from my first draft of my Unreal Museum.</p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>We continued to improve our museum by adding code to materials to customize their function. The code, or Blueprints, is a scripting system based on the concept of using a nodes (or the black boxes in the image below) to create gameplay elements. Basically, it codes shapes to do different actions at different times, such as open a door when walking in to a certain space. The blueprint below coded a lamp so that if the "F" key was clicked, it would light the lamp.</p>

				<p class="caption">This is the Blueprints that made a light able to be switched on when a button is clicked.</p>
			</div>
			
			</br>
			
			<p>The Blueprints made my museum interactive and unique. Finally, we created a video of our video game to represent the experience a player would receive.</p>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>I excelled in this project by investing more time and effort; I did extra tutorials, I added things to improve the aesthetic and overall feel, and I recreated the themes of museums. Unfortunately, all my projects did not end as well as the Unreal project did.</p>

			<h3>How I Struggled...</h3>
			
			<p>The project I struggled in the most was the Mini 3D Printing project. Up to this point, in Engineering Science, we had not done a project involving something that was actually going to be 3D printed. The purpose of the project was to design a part that would solve a problem, be useful, and would not waste filament. We created it in Inventor (a CADing program) and were required to use specific tools from this program. We then printed these through MarkerBot print and MakerBot 3D printers. I decided to create my 3D design to solve the problem of my sister's Alexa and where it was placed. She used to let it hang from the charging cord that was wrapped around the bars under the bunk bed. I decided to create a hanging shelf that the Alexa could rest on that hooked around the bunk bed bars and would allow for a charger. For me, the biggest challenge of the project was designing the hook that would hook around a bar, but I also had to make the shelf both functionally and pleasing to the eye. I did not want to waste filament, so when testing the hook out, I only printed that part. I had to do this once so I could be sure the result would work.</p> 
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/9thGradePage/MLogan_HookDraft1.jpg" alt="Hook Draft 1" style="width:200px;height:275px;">
		
				<p class="caption">This is my printed hook to test the fit and application.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>The test hook was extremely hard to get on and could barely come off without breaking, so I decided I needed to make the hook thinner and less of a complete circle. While talking to my Engineering Design teacher about this problem, he pointed out that I was missing one of the requirements, the use of the pattern tool. To save filament and create an eye-catching design, I decided to make a sun in the base. The pattern tool allows you to repeat a shape a chosen amount of times along a certain line, or in this case, around a certain point. I repeated the triangles around the center of the circle using the pattern tool, which definitely improved the aesthetic of the shelf. I printed the entire shelf with the deadline about a week away. I came home and was able to attach it to the bar and place the Alexa on it, but it tilted forward due to all the weight being in the front, and as soon as I tried to remove it, a piece of the hook broke off. The top of the hook extended too far around the bar and was not flexible enough.</p> 
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/9thGradePage/MLogan_3DSecondDraft.PNG" alt="3D Print Draft 1" style="width:375px;height:340px;">
		
				<p class="caption">This is the first draft of my printed shelf.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>The plastic had to be designed so that it was firm enough to hold an electronic up and flexible enough to be able to be removed. What I thought was the final print was not able to do this, so I needed to go back, and redesign the hook and support attaching the shelf and the hook.  I created filleted triangular cuts in the hook so that it could bend around the pole, but still detach. The fillet tool allows you make an edge curved with a radius of your choosing. The filleting of the cuts made sure the small cuts did not snap when bent.</p>
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/9thGradePage/MLogan_NewHook.PNG" alt="Hook Draft 2" style="width:375px;height:340px;">
		
				<p class="caption">New hook with filleted cuts.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>I also had to reposition the support so that the hook was closer to the center of the shelf. This would make sure that the shelf did not tip and leveled out the weight. I did this by adjusting my use of the loft tool. The loft tool allows you connect a solid shape through a plane to another solid shape. This means that I could create a curve and reduction in size between the hook and base while strengthening the connection. I also needed to move the charger hole down slightly and enlarge it so that it was not too high or small based on the position of the Alexa. The charger hole was created by making a slot and then cut extruding it through the back wall of the base. Cut extruding allows you to create a cut inside a predetermined shape and specify the depth of the cut.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/9thGradePage/MLogan_NewDesignFront.PNG" alt="3D Print Final Draft" style="width:400px;height:275px;">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/9thGradePage/MLogan_NewDesignSide.PNG" alt="3D Print Final Draft" style="width:400px;height:275px;">
				
				<p class="caption">These are images from my final draft of my hanging shelf.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>There is some filament not in perfect lines right below the hook. This is because I underestimated the amount of support the hook would need while being printed, as I was trying not to waste filament. Supports are small poles made out of filament by the printer during the printing process to hold up filament that would otherwise be laid on thin air. I adjusted the settings to make the supports thinner to save filament, but there was not enough there to hold all the filament up. But, everything considered, the final draft worked and was easily removable from the bar. It is still hanging and holding my sister’s Alexa today. In the next project we did this past year, I was able to turn my struggle in to growth.</p>

			<h3>How I Grew...</h3>
			
			<p>My greatest growth this year occurred during the Apocalyptic E-Book project. My growth was in my writing and editing abilities, how I look at the structure of writing, and communicating with my team members. In Language Arts, we had just finished reading Alas, Babylon, a 1950s apocalyptic novel. The goal of the project was to create an apocalyptic story with multiple characters and multiple authors that was set in 2017. We started by developing our characters and creating the situation in which the apocalypse would occur. The first draft I wrote was not very entertaining and told you nothing about my character or the details that make a story exciting.</p> 
			
			</br>
			</br>
			
			<div class="center">
				<img src="Images/Pictures/9thGradePage/StoryArtifact/MLogan_StoryScreenshotFirstDraft.PNG" alt="First Draft of Story" style="width:450px;height:555px;">
				<p class="caption">This is the first draft of my Apocalyptic Story.</p>
			</div>
			
			</br>
			
			<p>We wrote many prompts from our character’s point of view and developed their relationships with the other characters based on their situation. The apocalypse they experienced was caused by an EMP strike on American from North Korea; EMPs are a type of technological warfare that leave all electricity, communication devices, and technologies unusable. We had the requirements of the story being between 1,000-1,200 words, our stories follow a complete plot line, and that the characters are consistent throughout the stories. After expanding on my story from my first draft, I had added way too much detail and was at 1,604 words. I thought that it wouldn't be a problem to delete 400 words, but it took me multiple hours, conversing with multiple people, and recording and listening to myself reading it to get under the maximum amount of words. Because I had written the story, it was hard to spot places where information wasn't needed. This is where I grew in moving from the writing mindset to an editing mindset and learn how to edit properly. I had to research techniques used to reduce word count and ask for recommendations from Ms. Harris (my Language Arts teacher). It was also hard to communicate my character with my team members because they would also be writing my character in their story. We had to make sure that the stories started and ended at the correct time, and that the characters were undeviating throughout the stories. My final draft had a well-developed story that aligned with my group’s stories and described my character through her successes, struggles, how she developed, and  met the word count restrictions.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			
			<p>All of these projects and many other situations both at school and at home have helped me to develop as a person. The quality that has both helped me this year and I have experienced growth in is persistence. This quality will continue to help me in 10th grade because I can use it in almost any situation to make sure I perform my best and put out my best work no matter the circumstances. These projects and experiences from this past year have taught me how to adapt to any challenge and persist until I solve it. All of this will allow me to strive for my goals of a 4.0 GPA, being a part of National Honor Society, and growing in communication and teamwork for the coming school year.</p>
