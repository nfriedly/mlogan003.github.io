			<h3>My Growth in Genius Hour</h3>
			
			<p>I have had a growth this year during the Genius Hour Project. The Genius Hour Project was a project we did in Mrs. Campbell’s STEM Foundations class, the goal of the project was to learn more about something that interests the student, and the student spends several weeks researching their topic. The student then decides on the product they will share that will represent what they learned and why it is important. After this, we summarized our project in a web page that we then connected to our Portfolio. Through this project, I have grown in my knowledge of coding and my ability to create web pages that are pleasing to the eye.<br/>
			My class started Genius Hour by watching videos and learning about the purpose of Genius Hour. We then filled out a Word Document that contained three different topics, sources, and driving questions we could use. My three optional topics were stress as a student, the physics of ice skating, and how temperature affects baked goods. Stress is often a factor in everyone’s lives, including mine, and I wanted to know how stress directly and indirectly affected my life, how stress is best coped with, and how this information can help me as I transition in to high school. I have learned about &lt;div&gt; elements, &lt;hr&gt; elements, floating, padding, etc. This has made my website look more professional because I can position things more accurately and make my web page unique. You can see this in the difference between my website at the end of the 7th grade year and my Genius Hour Page today. I have made my website more pleasing to the eye by adding a background image, creating a coordinate color scheme, and using a font that is professional. My original web page was only two colors and was a simple font. My Genius Hour page now has an image of the galaxy as the background that makes it unique and personalizes the web page.<br/>
			The growth that I have experienced in these qualities can help me to produce more professional looking websites and have more complex coding. This can help me in the future when updating and adding to my Portfolio, and if I decide to become a website designer for my job, I will already know some of the content that I will have to be taught.
