			<h2>Entry 1</h2>
			
			<p>During sophomore year, I have faced many challenges that despite being a vexing have produced positive results. Stephan Richards accurately stated, “With every challenge you face, there is an opportunity…” and projects in Language Arts, Chinese, and Science Fair have given me the opportunity to grow. I have learned how to manage my time and myself, succeed despite being unprepared, and adapt to negative situations.</p></br>
			
			<p>In the first quarter of Language Arts, we completed the project titled The Role of an Individual and we focused on the driving question “What is an individual’s role in society?” To answer this we had to define a few content specific terms, create three artifacts, and look at multiple outside resources/create our own data. Throughout this project, I was challenged by time management, self-guided learning, and being self-driven. To prepare for the project and gain understanding of terms and background information, we read and analyzed the literary passages “Harrison Bergeron” and “Everyday Use”, and informational passages “Perspectives on Individualism, Collectivism, and the Greater Good” and “Self Reliance”. We then brainstormed possible artifacts we could make on the board. We began our 1st Artifact by going over the rubric as a class and determining what is needed in a research paper. I determined the passages that I would use, found a hook, and drafted the introduction, then posted a survey to fulfill the required community data and analyzed the results to answer the driving question based on the community data I collected. I received critique from Ms. Wheeler and multiple classmates and revised my paper to meet the rubric’s criteria. I began my 2nd Artifact by choosing the way I wanted it to be represented from Ms. Wheeler’s options. After choosing to do a poem, I found an image that inspired me and illustrated my stance on the driving question and wrote it based on this. I chose to use a Power Point in my Oral Presentation for my 3rd Artifact. I drafted a script, created notecards, and practiced before presenting to my classmates. Before this, we had not done many major projects without any check-ins as a class or guided completion. I struggled to determine what I needed to finish when and what I should be working on in class. To overcome this, I met with Ms. Wheeler and made a checklist of what I had left to do, had her critique my Artifacts several times, and made goals at the beginning of each class period of what I wanted to finish that day. This project has taught me self-drive, which will be needed to succeed in any career and has taught me how to better understand myself and other people based on my definition of their role and what they contribute to society.</p>

			<p>I also faced many challenges in my Chinese Pen Pal project. The purpose of the Chinese pen pal project was to learn more about China’s culture and recreational use of the language, and then create a PowerPoint to present our communications. Some of the trials that I faced in this project was the lack of organization and communication between our Chinese teacher and the teacher in China, coming up with email content, correctly using Chinese to communicate, and submitting my presentation in the correct format. First, I was assigned a partner from our Chinese class, Letty, and then we were assigned a pair of Chinese students to contact. We sent an opening email introducing ourselves in Chinese and received two different emails from our pen pals in English answering any questions we had. Due to communication issues between the teachers and their respective students, our teacher decided to simplify the format and have each person contact only one Chinese student. We then had to send a new email introducing ourselves in Chinese. Our pen pal then correct our Chinese in an email and respond in English in a separate email. When they responded in English, we would then correct their mistakes made in the reply, and start the process over by sending a new email in Chinese. I screenshotted all the emails that were sent and received in order to recreate the conversation in a presentation. The students were not given format requirements for the PowerPoint, so when our teacher decided to assign a format requirement the day before it was due, we were taken off guard. She drew pictures of the format up on the board, but I was absent, so that night all I had were photos of the board to go on and no explanation. Many of the people that were in class that day did not understand it, so when it was submitted, many people, including myself, got many points taken off for not meeting the format requirements. The next day, we explained to her why not many people had the correct format, and she allowed us to revise it that day and it would be due that night. Many people were able to understand it after talking to people that submitted it. I, more confused than most due to my absence, had to explain to her that despite the photos, I could not tell what order she wanted the slides in. She referred me to students who also had no idea what it was supposed to look like and had had another student help them format theirs. That night, I still had no idea what the presentation was supposed to look like and out of resources, had to figure it out myself. I asked other students for pictures of theirs, and with the photos of their PowerPoints and the board was able to guess the format. I overcame the lack of organization during the communicating between pen pals by not stressing out and instead understanding that I would be notified of information as soon as the situation was figure out. I overcame not understanding the format by relying on myself to figure out the format of the presentation. My PowerPoint not only demonstrates my growth in my ability to overcome the language barrier and improve my Chinese (you can see the progression in the complexity of my content), but also how I learned to be self-sufficient and trust myself to draw the correct conclusions.</p>

			<p>My final challenge was in Science Fair, and was unfortunately due to reason I could not control. Science Fair is required when taking Honors Biology and is not an actual class, so the only in schoolwork time provided is a period on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It is a data or engineering project that the student designs and completes, and then presents to judges. My partner, Aruna, and I chose to research how different types of plastic and plastic substitutes decompose in landfill and compost environments. To do this we had to bury samples of the plastics and dig them up to measure their decomposition. When we were about to start our experiment, we discovered that Aruna was going to be moving over winter break, which was only about three weeks away. We had previously decided to do a three-week experiment, so our project was not affected, but she would be 1,800 miles away when I would be finishing the writing piece and presenting. To resolve this, she decided to do the experiment herself before she moved and then I would take the data, finish, and display our project at the exhibitions that she could not make it to. It was somewhat inconvenient, but the situation could not be changed, so Aruna and I had to adapt. Learning to adapt and improve my chances of success when plans change is a skill that is required in everyday life, and through Science Fair, I was able to practice doing this.</p>

			<p>Throughout this past year, I have adapted to a situation that I deemed impossible, been self-motivating and managed my time, and been successful without a project being completely structured. These experiences will help my in college, when I get a job, and overall life. I have used the opportunities presented to me by the challenges to grow.</p></br>
